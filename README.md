### Steps to Run the App
1. Download XCode (sorry ☹️)
2. Open file named FetchRewardsRecipes.xcodeproj
3. Click the "play" button in the top left

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritized creating a modular architecture, so that the unit tests could work most effectively. I think the concurrency aspect is handled well. I also spent time to make the UI very intuitive and easy to use.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I made an initial effort just to get things working, and figuring out what I wanted the app to look like. This was about 3 hours (not continuously). Then I came back to the code to refactor various aspects such that it is "production-ready". This was probably another 3 hours. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I did not spend more time to add extra features to the app, such as filtering the data, or displaying an alphabetical index, or displaying the larger photo. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I did not write any code to specifically address image caching.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
Yes, I used Kingfisher, which is a library I've used for years.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
This was my first time working with Swift Testing. I really enjoyed learning about it.
